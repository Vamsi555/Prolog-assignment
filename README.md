This repository contains a Prolog implementation of a family-tree knowledge base. I designed the program which defines basic facts such as gender and parent relationships and includes rules for deriving higher-level relationships including siblings, grandparents, cousins and descendants. To run the program, open a Prolog environment such as SWI-Prolog or the online SWISH interpreter. Load the family_tree.pl file into the interpreter, then submit queries (e.g., sibling(juma, S)., grandparent(evelyn, G)., descendant(D, khalid).) to retrieve relationship information using Prolog’s logical inference engine. The system evaluates each query according to the defined rules and returns all matching results.
